## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This is a meditation application. It is used to track how many minutes of  meditating you did each day and provide a guide of how to meditate. The app not only tracks how long they have been meditating, but also teaches people who are new to meditation. Users can also share their stories and experiences with each other. Users can get push notifications, information on breathing exercises, session history, and customized music. The idea of the application comes from one of the teammates who meditates, and we all agree that it’s a great idea to build a meditation app.
